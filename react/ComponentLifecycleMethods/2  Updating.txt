---------------------------------------------- [ Updating ] ----------------------------------------------

staticgetDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
    - Called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM when new props or state are received.


shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
    - Called before rendering when new props or state are being received. Used to decide whether the component should re-render. Returning false prevents the update.


render()
    - Called to render the component’s JSX.


getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)
    - Called right before the most recently rendered output is committed to the DOM. Used to capture information (e.g., scroll position) that can be used after the update.


componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
    - Called after the component’s updates are flushed to the DOM. Used for performing side effects after the update. The snapshot value returned by getSnapshotBeforeUpdate is passed to this method.
