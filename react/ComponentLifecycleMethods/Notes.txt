Component lifecycle methods in react are special methods that are special methods that are invoked
at different stages of a components's existence

these methods allow you to hook into specific points of the component's lifecycle to run code such as
fethcing data, cleaning up resources, or updating the DOM

Lifecycle methods in class components are divided into three phases
    1. Mounting
        - These methods are called when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM
    2. Updating
        - These methods are called when a comopnent is being re-rendered as a result of changes to props or state
    3. Unmounting
        - These methods are called when a component is being removed from the DOM
