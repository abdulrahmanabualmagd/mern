### MongoDB Terminology       

    1. Database               : A container for collections.
    2. Collection             : A group of MongoDB documents. Equivalent to a table in relational databases.
    3. Document               : A single record or data entity within a collection. Represented as a JSON-like object.
    4. Field                  : A key-value pair within a document.
    5. Index                  : A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a collection.
    6. Query                  : A request to retrieve data from a collection based on specified criteria.
    7. Aggregation            : A framework for performing data manipulation operations on documents in a collection.
    8. Replica Set            : A group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set, providing high availability and redundancy.
    9. Sharding               : Horizontal partitioning of data across multiple MongoDB instances to improve scalability.
    10. GridFS                : A specification for storing and retrieving large files in MongoDB.


### Mongoose Terminology      

    1. Schema                 : A blueprint that defines the structure of documents within a collection.
    2. Model                  : A constructor compiled from a schema. Represents a collection in MongoDB.
    3. Middleware             : Functions that execute before or after certain operations (e.g., save, validate) on a model.
    4. Validation             : Rules defined within a schema to enforce data integrity.
    5. Population             : The process of automatically replacing specified paths in a document with documents from other collections.
    6. Plugin                 : Reusable pieces of code that add functionality to Mongoose schemas.
    7. Connection             : An instance of the Mongoose connection to a MongoDB database.
    8. Query                  : A method provided by Mongoose to retrieve documents from a collection based on specified criteria.
    9. Document               : An instance of a model representing a single MongoDB document.
    10. Virtuals              : Additional fields for a document that are not stored in the database but computed on access.
